              <p class=projectnamesb>Skateboard Design<br>
                 <span class="introsb">Another passion project, I was fascinated by the Welcome skateboards and wanted to create one that fits their brand.</span> <br>
                 <span class="introparagraphsb">Welcome is a fairly new skate company. They were founded in 2010, and have grown dramatically ever since. Their mission statement starts as a "desire to embrace and promote the ever-shrinking subcultural side of skateboarding". They do that by making decks and apparel different than most companies. Each board is unique and doesn't necessarily follow the same style as the one next to it; however, all boards seem to fit perfectly together.</span> </p>
                 
               <div class="columnsb"></div>
                 
               <p class=categorytitlesb>Design<br>
                  <span class="bluesb">At first, I knew I wanted to make a skateboard deck; however, I wasn't sure what I wanted to make. To solve that problem I did research</span><br>
                    <span class="paragraphsb">Here, I found Welcome. Then I did further research. I looked into the brand and noticed their style. It was captivating. The line-work was precise, and the splash of color added to the decks looked both thrown on, and carefully placed. I wanted to embody that style. I do not have the best drawing capabilities, so I knew I had to practice my design over and over until I felt comfortable free-handing it on the board. I decided to draw the unicorn skull because it was ironic. Unicorns are seen as being majestic creatures, and no one thinks of a Unicorn skeleton. The blunt was a repeating feature on some boards so I wanted to bring that in as well.</span> </p>
                 
               <p class=categorytitletwosb>Process<br>
                  <span class="bluesb">To my surprise, designing a skateboard deck has many more steps to it then painting the deck.</span><br>
                   <span class="paragraphtwosb">First I needed to get my design figured out. Once I did a few small sketches in my moleskin, I was able to choose the design I liked best. From here, I began to add more details to the design. Once happy with that, I tried to replicate the same size of the design that would be on the board. This helped me get muscle memory for when I was going to do the real design on the board. Once happy with that, I could start on the actual board.<br>
                     <br>To begin I needed possession of a plain wood board. I bought one online and unboxed it when it arrived. Then, I noticed that there was already a gloss residue on the board as a finish. I got sandpaper and began sanding it down. Once happy with the results, and the sandpaper was applied to the whole board, I could move onto the next step. Here, I removed the excess sawdust, then began to spray paint the board a white color. This took about 5 coats on each side. I was in no rush, and I let the board dry for about thirty minutes to an hour in-between coats. Once happy with the base, I began to slowly outline the design on the board, then went over it with the necessary mediums.</span> </p>

                <p class="threesb">Finished Product<br>
                 <span class="bluesb">I call it <i>Unicorn Skull</i>. Not the most creative name, but it makes sense for the graphic.</span>
                   <span class="threeinfosb">Below one can see the finished product. In all honesty, this project was out of my comfort zone; however, I am happy I took on the project.</span>
