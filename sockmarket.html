              <span class="introparagraphsm"> This project was sought out because I wanted to create an experience for the user that would be seamless, beneficial for the user to use, and effective in completing the task at hand. Below one can see my process from start to finish for The Sock Market.</span> </p>

            UX Challenges
            <p class="textsm">Since The Sock Market was a passion project, I had to <b>create guidelines and deadlines for myself</b>. That was a fairly new concept since most of my work prior had the deadlines set. Another challenge was <b>deciding which problem I wanted to solve</b>. There were two problems that I wanted to address; however, each required a different approach, and I could not afford to focus on that big of a picture because I would be spreading myself too thin. </p>

            UX Solutions
            <p class="textsm">For my first challenge, I learned that <b>creating a to-do list</b> for each day helped with finishing the project. Next, I was debating on finding a solution for an app that allowed one to donate clothing locally and keep track of it (The Sock Market), or an app that would simplify the donation process for a facility of one's choice. I chose to address the first problem because <b>I saw an opportunity. Once I completed the solution to the first problem, I could simply add a feature in The Sock Market which allows one to choose a different donation facility</b>, if so pleased. </p>

            <p class=categorytitlesm>Problem  <br>
               <span class="bluesm">Donating apparel should be a self-rewarding task; however, we never seem to look forward to it. </span><br>
                 <span class="paragraphsm">After random interviews were conducted, I found that it takes about 2 weeks for someone to complete the donation process. This includes deciding which articles of clothing to donate, packing the box to donate the clothing, and going to the donation facility to drop it off. Most users explained that the process is elongated because it seems as though other high-priority tasks arise, and one forgets about the donation or sees it as a low-priority. When asked if people enjoyed donating clothing, an ample amount of users said no. Once asked to elaborate, they explained that in theory, donating clothing is a good deed; however, its <b>process is tedious</b>.</span> </p>
              
            <p class=categorytitletwosm>Research & Analysis  <br>
               <span class="bluesm">My research and analysis process first began in my sketchbook. I jotted down a few key factors to consider when creating this app.</span><br>
                <span class="paragraphtwosm">Before jumping into the design part of things, I needed to know whom I was creating this experience for, what kind of experience it should be, and the goals/outcome of the experience. For starters, I did a simple who, what, when, where and why. From here, I was able to jot down what I believed should be the <b>objectives</b> of the product, and <b>assumptions</b> I already had of the product and user. Once a few iterations of the objectives and assumptions were complete and had a stronger foundation, I jumped into the <b>problem statement</b>. I like to think of this as the connecting factor. Whenever I would feel like I am straying away from the purpose of the application, I would glance at the problem statement to make sure I was still on track. From the problem statement came the <b>hypothesis</b>. <br>
                  <br>After I was happy with this information, I made a few <b>personas</b> of the target audience then I created a <b>card sort</b> and had random participants fill it out so I could gain a broad scope of how everyone viewed the main componenets of the application.</span> </p>
            <div class=researchsm></div>
              
            <p class="threesm">Design Thinking & Sketches <br>
              <span class="bluesm">I created napkin tests and tested those on people that fit my target audience. After, I created user-flows and wireframes.</span>
                <span class="threeinfosm">For this particular project, I wanted to observe how people were viewing the information provided to them because I wanted to get out of a designer's perspective. For that reason, I did simple <b>napkin tests</b> on random participants while taking into consideration the data received from the card sort. Here, I was able to observe how/why they were doing certain tasks compared to other options. It helped that most participants were open about talking out loud and explaining their thought processes. This helped me immensely to know that I was headed in the right direction. <br>
                  <br>
                  After the napkin tests, I created a <b>user-flow</b>. This was created to help me visualize what I had essentially been thinking about for the past few days. I then created low-fidelity <b>wireframes</b> in my sketchbook for the main components of the app. When brought into Figma, I started with these and created them virtually. Before getting too far, I created a <b>pattern library</b> to help me stay consistent in my styling.</span>
              </p>
              <div class=designsm></div>
              
               <p class="foursm">Prototype & Launch Test <br>
              <span class="bluesm">Once all of the components were created, I was able to make a high-fidelity prototype, then I could test the product.</span>
                <span class="fourinfosm">With the help of the pattern library, I was able to create static wireframes in Figma. Once I was happy with the wireframes, I took them into <b>Invision</b> to create a more realistic <b>prototype</b>. <br> <br>
                  Once the product was complete, I was able to <b>test</b> it on participants who met the demographic for the app. I used a simple online app that allowed me to record the participants (with their permission of course) so I could later use it as a source to reference if needed. Since this was the first launch, there is still much more to improve for the Sock Market. <b>What worked was  .... and what needs improvement is ....</b></span>
