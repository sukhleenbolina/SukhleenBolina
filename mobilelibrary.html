             <span class="introml">What is the best way to design the inside of the library for adaptivity?</span> <br>
             <span class="introparagraphml"> The purpose of this project was to give us students experience of real-world problems. A client from the Spokane City Library District approached the class, and shared their UX challenge. It was our job to decide how to solve it, and what the best approach method was.</span> </p>

           UX Challenges
           <p class="textml">A common problem I noticed between all groups participating in this project was that <b>clear direction was not given to the designers to see what the client wanted</b>. It was our responsibility to know what the client wants, without them necessarily saying it. Another problem was <b>deciding what layout would lead to the best adaptations without knowing exactly what materials would be added in the vehicle</b>. </p>

           UX Solutions
           <p class="textml">For my first challenge, I learned that <b>as a UX designer, it is my responsilbity to know what questions to ask so I can receive the most beneficial infomration</b>. This might seem obvious now, but at the time, most of my UX assigments were neatly laid out since they were hypothetical. I also learned that <b>since I do not know exactly what would be placed in the mobile library, I had to make something that could repeatedly change its layout</b>. </p>

           <p class=categorytitleml>Problem  <br>
              <span class="blueml">Certain areas of Spokane are deprived of local libraries, which in return strips children from enjoying library emenities.</span><br>
                <span class="paragraphml">For the first day the client approached our class, she explained how certain <b>bordering areas of Spokane did not have libraries</b>. Her solution was of course, the Mobile Library; however, this came with its own problems. <b>The Mobile Library should act as any other ordinary library, just on wheels</b>. It should serve as a classroom, carry at least 100 books, act as a science lab, have chargers for laptops, and working laptops/storage.</span> </p>
             
           <p class=categorytitletwoml>Research & Analysis  <br>
              <span class="blueml">Most of our research was provided by the Client beforehand. It was our responsibility to ask the right questions so we had a better understanding of what was wanted/expected.</span><br>
               <span class="paragraphtwoml">At first, one would think the task being asked is not so difficult. Just look at other libraries on wheels and follow their layout right? It isn't that simple. We learned that most Mobile Libraries were actually being used in places like sunny California. Spokane, and Washington in general has all four seasons; therefore, certain features like a large horizontally opening side window would not be ideal. It would only be used for about 3 months before the weather became grey. <b>We learned from the client what emenities she wanted to include.</b>. <br>
                 <br>For her second visit, we thought of a few more questions to ask her.<b>The questions were "What technological limitations are there to building the mobile library? In general, you can't have both hybrid and all-wheel drive for any mode of transportation. Is there another mobile library running in bad weather? What are they doing? What options are there to run electricity? What are emergency procedures? Would those required features be installed already? What features take up the most weight capacity?"</b>. With the answers to these questions we were able to write down key features that the Client absolutely wanted, and other informatio nregarding the library on sticky notes so we could later reference the notes.</span> </p>

           <p class="threeml">Design Thinking <br>
             <span class="blueml">My group and I decided that the best approach to having a flexible layout was a more tactile pattern library.</span>
               <span class="threeinfoml">As mentioned earier, it was our responsibility to find a solution, and justify it. My group believed that a <b>pattern library</b> would be the best way to present the solution. We would have assets cut out (such as bookshelves, chairs, stoage), and a few rectangular 2-D boxes that represented the 4 views of the library. The boxes were on a three feet by two feet paper, so all the commitee could gather around the paper, and the assets were provided in a ziplock baggie so one could have a secure place for them.<br>
                 <br>
                 The assets were also <b>color-coded</b> so one could easily distinguish from pieces such as bookshelves and chairs. We also tried to simplify the shape of most features, but not so much that they all looked the same. We felt as though this would be the best solution because paper is easily morphed, and one could design the board exactly how they wanted as many times as they wanted without being concerned of material. We also decided to go with a large board-size so about 5-6 people could gather around and observe the layout.</span>

             <p class="fourml">Feedback from Client<br>
             <span class="blueml">Our solution was chosen to use when deciding the best layout for the Mobile Library.</span>
               <span class="fourinfoml">What I noticed that may have differentiated the group I was in, compared to other groups was that 
                 <b>we thought of little details</b> 
                 such as the fire-extinguisher, the comfort of the driver, along with the passenger. We also took the liberty to 
                 <b>print out our pattern library</b>, and not just give the client a file.
                 <b>What I think we could have improved on was </b>finding a solution from moving the pattern library from point A to point Bb. This was more of a low-priority task, because most of our attention was focused on the pattern library.</span>
