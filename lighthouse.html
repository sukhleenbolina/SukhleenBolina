                  <span class="introl">How can augmented reality be used to help normalize terms such as <i>visually impaired, blind</i>, and <i>disabled</i></span> <br>
                  <span class="introparagraphl"> I was given the task to create a new technology that used emerging technology. The lengths and directions of whom this technology would benefit were solely up to me. I decided to create a pitch idea for Lighthouse. This would be a feature on your latest mobile devices.</span> </p>
                  
                <div class="columnl"></div>
                  
                <p class=categorytitlel>Background<br>
                   <span class="bluel">When new technology arises, it seems as though accessibility features have the same capabilities, and don't advance with the new technology.</span><br>
                     <span class="paragraphl"><b>Braille has been around since 1824</b>, and it is still the number one choice for tactile language for someone who is visually impaired; however, there is a new font, <b>Elia</b>. This font is also raised and can be <b>learned in 2-3 hours compared to braille</b>, which takes about 1 year to master. With the partnership of Elia and augmented reality, I believe that future technology <b>can advance further in accessibility and positively reinforce the use of Elia</b>, alongside making it a common language everyone in the United States can read, so almost anyone can benefit from using Lighthouse.</span> </p>
                  
                <p class=categorytitletwol>What is it & how does it work? <br>
                   <span class="bluel">Lighthouse is a built-in feature that would be available on the latest mobile devices that would read Elia and provide information to you depending on your setting.</span><br>
                    <span class="paragraphtwol">Lighthouse would use existing technologies and combine them to create something that has not been fully developed yet. How it works is that there would be an <b>electronic finger recognition feature</b> on the back of the mobile devices. Connected to the electronic finger recognition feature would be a <b>sensor pad</b>. As one could assume, you would place your finger on the sensor pad and receive information through the pad. This technology would greatly benefit someone who is visually imapried; however, it is not limited to just them.<br>
                      <br>One might be thinking how would you understand what the sensor pad is telling you? That is where Elia and augmented reality technology comes in. If someone who is visually impaired were to learn Elia or someone who was willing it learn Elia, then they too would understand what the sensor pad is telling them because it would be <b>translating information and outputting it in Elia</b>. The reason you would use this feature is to understand your surroundings in a new area. This would benefit someone who is visually impaired because for example say if they walked into a new cafe and wanted to see the closest seating, all they would have to do is pull out their phone and read the information being sent to them. Another feature would include providing information about certain objects in front of the user when the device is horizontally facing it. This could be used if someone wanted to gain more context of what was in front of them, rather than the whole area. Essentially, Lighthouse would allow for non-verbal communication.</span> </p>

                 <p class="threel">AR Technology<br>
                  <span class="bluel">The main technology used to make lighthouse work is SLAM tracking.</span>
                    <span class="threeinfol">If one is unfamiliar with SLAM tracking, it is when a <b>device knows your surroundings</b> (similar to allowing your phone to know your location) and would use that to their knowledge to provide the best information to the user. This is necessary for Lighthouse to work because it is currently the only reliable source that could provide the most accurate information regarding someone's location. The type of information sent would be based on analytics. Depending on what information is provided, the users' actions determine and filter the information for the next person to use Lighthouse in that same location. Essentially, it would be a self-filtering.<br>
                      <br>
                      Other technologies that would be necessary for Lighthouse to work is <b>haptic feedback</b>. Haptic feedback is when your touch sensor is activated and used to communicate. This would make the most sense since this product is targeted to someone who is visually impaired, and for someone who isn't, haptic feedback is already something everyone has experienced. Another technology would be <b>GPS</b>. This is necessary for SLAM technology to properly work. Without GPS, your device wouldn't be able to tell you where you are, and Lighthouse could not work. If someone was not interested in Lighthouse, they could simply turn their location off as well.</span>

                 <p class="fourl">Concerns & Meta<br>
                  <span class="bluel">Here I will address some concerns with Lighthouse & why I believe the pros outweigh the cons.</span>
                    <span class="fourinfol"><b>Privacy</b> is a big concern as we venture further & further into the future. By using Lighthouse, you are allowing your device to know where you are when the feature is in use, and that is concerning for most people. Technically we already allow our devices to do just that. It is not in our power to know what/how our data is being used. We put our trust in the apps we download and they have control over that data. As long as one isn't breaking all societal rules, I think it should be fine. Another concern would be who is <b>running the computer management system</b>, and how are they updating it. As mentioned before, if we plan to move on with technology and not get left behind, we will have to adapt to having transparency around us at all times.<br> <br>
                       Okay, so how do the pros outweigh the cons? I believe that with the partnership of Lighthouse and mobile devices, this feature has a real chance of <b>reshaping the negative connotations associated with words such as disabled, visually impaired, and blind</b>. From here on out, this feature would have the ability to create a stronger community and normalize the terms mentioned above. <b>It is our responsibility to use the emerging technologies for good</b>.</span>
