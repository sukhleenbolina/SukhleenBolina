              <p class=projectnameg>Google Doodle<br>
                 <span class="introg">I was given the task to create a Google Doodle for any topic. I chose books.</span> <br>
                 <span class="introparagraphg">The constraints for this project included that I would have to code the project by hand, I needed to use Javascript, and the Google Doodle had to be for a certain holiday or day of the year. The Google Doodle also had to be interactive in one way or another. This project spiked my interest in the background and reasoning behind Google Doodles. I learned that the Google Doodle was being meticulously thought out before the company even launched. It was a unique way for Google to display their logo. Google goes on to say "While the first doodle was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born."</span> </p>

               <p class=categorytitleg>Concept of Design<br>
                  <span class="blueg">My topic choices ranged dramatically when I was brainstorming before deciding on books.</span><br>
                    <span class="paragraphg">As mentioned above, I was having a hard time deciding on what it was I wanted to create for the Google Doodle. My ideas ranged from replicating a piece of Salvador Dali's, but with the Google colors, creating a bookshelf with the words Google hidden, having a Google Doodle for national puppy day, or creating a doodle out of art supplies. Once I picked the bookshelf topic, I started to visualize what it would be. I went through a few iterations before deciding on the layout that was coded out.</span> </p>
                 
               <p class=categorytitletwog>Coding<br>
                  <span class="blueg">As with every coding project, this process had a few unwanted design styles that I wanted to debug.</span><br>
                   <span class="paragraphtwog">First, I created the bookshelf I envisioned in Illustrator. I included the Google logo and created it out of the same books but in Google colors. Once happy with the overall image, I exported the code of the image in an SVG.<br>
                     <br>Now that I had the background of my Google Doodle, I could use the template provided by our professor to start coding certain aspects. The goal was to make it seem like you would be searching for the Google logo because there is always a logo, it just may be hidden. I had a black overlay, with a white shining light in the corner that was created with JQuery. Once you move the mouse across the scene, the light moves with it. After I was happy with the layout in Codepen, I created a repository for the project. I did my initial commit, made a few more tweaks, and did a few more commits.</span> </p>

                 <span class="blueg">The finished product is the doodle you see below!</span>
                   <span class="threeinfog">I would say I am happy with how the project turned out. If there was something I would change, it would possibly be decreasing the opacity on the black layer so it would be easier to find the Google logo.</span>
