             <span class="introparagraphr"> This projects purpose is to review the customer service of Calexico's with an inhouse product. We chose to focus on the customer service because the number one reason most people write a negative review is correlated to a negative experince with customer service.</span> </p>

           UX Challenges
           <p class="textr">A problem I encountered when testing this app was <b>deciding how much information to give a user before a test</b>. I wanted the user to know what Calexico's was; however, I wanted them to understand the purpose of the app without having to explain what it does. Another challenge I faced was <b>deciding on the vocabulary used</b>. No one wants to write a harsh review of someone, so I had to find a way to ask a customer to essentially write a critique of a server they had no prior knowledge of before walking into the door.</p>

           UX Solutions
           <p class="textr">When deciding what information to provide a tester, I found that it helped me if I wrote down what was <b>absolutely necessary for the user to know beforehand</b>. Then, if there was any confusion, I asked after the test. For the second problem, I ended up doing a bit of my own research to first see the tone of Calexico's. Then from here, I figured the <b>best solution was to follow the tone of the restaurant.</b> In this case, it was friendly and inviting.</p>

           <p class=categorytitler>Problem  <br>
              <span class="bluer">Negative restaurant ratings are predominately based off of negative customer experiences.</span><br>
                <span class="paragraphr">The specific problem statement for this project is that <b>Calexico's needs a tool that is measurable and contains valid data that will in return increase restaurant ratings</b>. After looking into both Calexico's and its competetors, I found that the negative reviews for the restaurants were predominately based off of negative experiences with customer service. My focus was more directed towards Calexico's so I was focused on finding what would be the pain points for this specific restaurant. From here, I was able to move onto the next step, the research.</span> </p>
             
           <p class=categorytitletwor>Research & Analysis  <br>
              <span class="bluer">Most of my research starts in the same area, my sketchbook. I started with the simple who, what, when, where, and why.</span><br>
               <span class="paragraphtwor">As for most projects, I began with trying to understand my user, and the purpose of this application. For starters, I began with the <b>goals</b> of the product. What was I trying to solve, and how was I going to do so. Then I jumped into the <b>assumptions</b>. Here I would write my assumptions of the user that were a bit more obvious compared to others. Some things would be the general demographic of the people attending Calexico's, and a general Calexico's target audience. This was already addressed, but I later moved onto defining the<b>problem statement</b> in more depth. Here, I would include the persona of the user, how they are feeling, and in what ways Calexico's could address their concerns before having the user write a negative review on a third-party platform. After definging the problem statement, I wrote a <b>hypothesis</b> of how this problem could be solved. <br>
                 <br>Based off of the target audience Calxico's is projecting their business to, I was able to create <b>personas, then epics, then user-stories</b>. In the personas, I had included a name, to make it more personal, an age, the goals of the user, and frustrations. With this, I was able to build onto the next steps.</span> </p>
           <div class=researchr></div>
             
           <p class="threer">Design Thinking & Sketches <br>
             <span class="bluer">Wireframes then napkin tests... then repeat!</span>
               <span class="threeinfor">I knew from the start that this product would ideally replicate a survey format. I concluded with this idea because it is something everyone is familiar with. With this information, I began the basic <b>low-fidelty wireframes</b>. Whenever I would get into a stump, I would either do a <b>napkin tests or conduct A/B testing</b>. The type of short user-test would depend on the solution I was looking for. If it was deciding between two layouts, and which one is more successful in completing the task, I would choose A/B testing. If I just needed some confimation that I was heading in the right direction, I would show random users that fit in my target audience the napkin tests.<br>
                 <br>
                 Once the general layout for the Rate Your Server application was complete, I started to create <b>user-flows digitally</b>. Once again, if I was in a stump, I would do a simple test. Since I was creating an application that would be an add on to existing services for Calexico's, a pattern library was not necessary; for the restaurant already had their own identity standard guide.</span>

              <p class="fourr">Prototype & Launch Test <br>
             <span class="bluer">After two successful tests with the low-fidelity wireframes, I started on the high-fidelity wireframes.</span>
               <span class="fourinfor">I had used <b>invision</b> to create a high-fidelty <b>prototype</b> for the Rate Your Server application. <br> <br>
                 Once happy with the high-fidelity prototype, I was able to use <b>Loom</b>, and do a final test on participants. Before beginning the test, I explained why I needed their help, and some backgorund information on the project along with Calexico's. After the information gathered from the tests, I noticed a few patterns. <b>What seemed to work was the actual design of the app and how it emulated to be a product of Calexico's. What needed improvement on for the next launch is the vocabulary</b>. The first two questions, even though different seemed similar to the users. I now know that, and can change how the questions are being presented so less confusion arises when using the product. </span>
