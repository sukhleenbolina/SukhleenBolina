          <p>Hypothetically, when one goes to rate a restaurant, they rate their experience with customer service. A way to prove that was to create a rate your server app. If the ratings match those of the resturant, then we would know we were correct. I created a rate your server app that would be brought to the customer at the table, along with their check. Dsiplayed on an IPad, the customer would just have to click through a few pages. The servers have already logged into the app so the customer would not have to scroll through numerous servers just to find theirs. I stylized my rate your server app off of the restaurant Calexico's. <br> <br> <br>

          <p>Brain notes. This app was made for educators ranging from pre-school, to university professors. Learning names isn't the easiest task to complete, especially when you have 25-100 kids in your class. This app was created so an educator can learn their student's names fast, which would in turn help the educator and student create a bond quicker. This app would be something purchased by a school, such as canvas or schoology. From there, the app is customizable according to preference. Two games are available to choose from to help remember student names. They are matching, and flashcards. If the app grows, so does its range of games, and customizations.<br> <br> <br>

          <p>This Spokane city guide was made for adults ranging from 21-40 who are either visiting spokane, or are looking for a new perspective on Spokane. The style of the city guide is bright, and motivating. Most people's bodies do not act the same as they did when they were 16, you cannot eat whatever you want. This guide makes eating healthy a fun experience, by bringing in characters and somewhat of a Spokane scavenger hunt, for the character found in the city guide, are found all around the city. The best way to find the cartoons is to go to the destinations in the book! The use the hastag #SpokaneGreenz and share your story about Spokane, or your experience looking for the characters. <br> <br> <br>

          <p>The Lorax. A classic Dr. Suess, and what better time than now to make a movie trailer website about a movie that promotes the enviornmental health of the trees. When given this project, we were told to create a movie trailer website and customize the video. This is important for various reasons, one of them being you can capture the identity of the movie in the customizations of the video if done correctly, another reason is that you do not have to worry about a trailer that may be competing with yours to play right after your movie, like youtube might do. Also, this movie trailer website would be a great way to attract customers to your movie.<br> <br> <br>
